Trivia Inspiration: 

This general knowledge trivia game was designed with every student at heart. As an educator, I enjoy playing trivia games 

with my students for practice of skills but also as a fun way to discover new and interesting facts!   

How to play: 

On the intro screen, there are a set of rules to follow. The rules are as follows: 
1. You have 60 seconds to answer 15 general knowledge questions accurately!
2. Click the button of the correct answer. 
3. You will not be able to change your response once selected! 
4. Your total score will be revealed at the end of the game.


Once the "Let's Play" button has been selected, you will immediately begin playing the trivia. 
There is a question counter and countdown timer of 60 seconds displayed on the screen. Click the correct answer. 
If the answer is 'correct', the container will turn green; if the answer is 'incorrect', the container will turn red. 

If the time runs out, a "Time is Up" screen will show to display the number of questions you answered correctly. 
If you complete the trivia, a congratulations screen will display to show the number of questions you answered correctly.
You will be able to restart the game! 

This game was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
